  The style tags are responsible for a lot of the magic that happens
  inside the QFramework. Unfortunately, there is not yet a complete
  documentation of all available options. Many tags are documented in
  the comments of the functions in which they are read out, but the
  location at which they are documented is sometimes not obvious.</p>
<p>
  However, there <i>is</i> an automatically generated overview list of
  all tags that are hardcoded within the QFramework to help you find
  the names and locate the documentation comments for some particular
  tag: <a href="tags.txt">list of tags</a>
